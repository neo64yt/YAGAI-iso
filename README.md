# YAGAI-iso
This repository stores the source for the ISO image of Yet Another Graphical Arch Installer (YAGAI). To find the script, go to https://github.com/neo64yt/YAGAI instead.

## Dependencies
* Pure Arch installation (Arch containers can also be used)
* archiso
* Patience (especially if your machine is underpowered)

## How to build the ISO image
Go into the `archiso` directory, and just run `./buildiso.sh`. Once the build is finished, the ISO image should be in `out` by default.
